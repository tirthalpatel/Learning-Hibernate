Mapping one-to-one Association
------------------------------

* This is similar to component, but mapped differently. One entity maps directly to single entity (Ensure bi-directional implementation and mapping)

* One-to-one association can be mapped by many-to-one association and declaring unique=“true”

* For example, One person has one passport & each passport can belong to one person.
